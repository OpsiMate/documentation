# Uptime Kuma Integration

The **Uptime Kuma integration** lets you send alerts from **Uptime Kuma** into OpsiMate using webhook-based push notifications.

Instead of OpsiMate pulling status from Uptime Kuma, your Uptime Kuma notifications push alerts directly to OpsiMate.

## Webhook URL

Configure your Uptime Kuma notification to send alerts to your OpsiMate server.

Use your OpsiMate alerts webhook endpoint, for example:

```pgsql
http://localhost:3001/api/v1/alerts/custom/uptime-kuma?api_token={your_api_token}
```

> Replace `{your_api_token}` with the API token configured in your OpsiMate server.  

The exact path segment (for example `uptime-kuma`) should match how the Uptime Kuma integration is configured in your OpsiMate backend.

## API Token Configuration

The API token used in the webhook URL is managed by OpsiMate through an environment variable:

- **Env var:** `API_TOKEN`  
- **Default value:** `opsimate`  

This value is also used as the default for the `api_token` query parameter in the webhook URL.

If you are using the simple deployment (via the provided `docker-compose.yml`), the `API_TOKEN` environment variable is already defined there for you.

Make sure your OpsiMate server is started with `API_TOKEN` set (or rely on the default), and use the same value in the Uptime Kuma webhook URL.

## Setting Up the Webhook in Uptime Kuma

To send alerts from Uptime Kuma to OpsiMate via webhook:

1. In **Uptime Kuma**, go to **Settings → Notifications**.
2. Click **Add New Notification**.
3. Choose **Webhook** as the notification type.
4. Set the URL to your OpsiMate endpoint, for example:

```pgsql
http://your-opsimate-host/api/v1/alerts/custom/uptime-kuma?api_token={your_api_token}
```

5. Keep the HTTP method as **POST**.  
6. *(Optional)* Adjust the payload/template only if you have customized parsing on the OpsiMate side; otherwise, use the default JSON payload from Uptime Kuma.  
7. Save the notification.  
8. Attach this notification to the monitors you want to forward to OpsiMate.

## Important Disclaimer

Uptime Kuma sends webhooks **only to publicly reachable HTTP endpoints**.

- If you are running OpsiMate locally (for example at `http://localhost:3001`), Uptime Kuma running on a different machine or in the cloud may not be able to call this URL directly.  
- For production use, deploy OpsiMate behind a publicly reachable URL (or expose it securely via tunneling / reverse proxy) so that Uptime Kuma can reach the webhook endpoint.

Once configured, alerts pushed from Uptime Kuma will appear in the **alerts table** in OpsiMate with the **Uptime Kuma integration icon**, so you can easily identify their source.

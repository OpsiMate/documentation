# Deploy OpsiMate

OpsiMate is designed for easy deployment using Docker. This guide will walk you through deploying OpsiMate using Docker run commands.

:::info Before You Begin
Make sure your system meets the [system requirements](system-requirements) and that Docker is installed and running.
:::

## Quick Deployment

### Docker Run Command

Deploy OpsiMate with a single Docker command:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name opsimate \
  --rm \
  -p 3001:3001 -p 8080:8080 \
  opsimate/opsimate
```

### Volume Mounts

| Volume | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `/app/data/database` | SQLite database persistence |
| `/app/data/private-keys` | SSH private keys for authentication |
| `/app/config/config.yml` | Custom configuration |

:::success
OpsiMate is now running at `http://localhost:8080`
Register a user for the first time - it will be the first admin user
:::

### Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check container status
docker ps | grep opsimate

# View application logs
docker logs opsimate

# Check health status
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

## First Login

When you first access OpsiMate at `http://localhost:8080`, you'll be prompted to create your first admin user:

<img src="/img/first-login.png" alt="Screenshot of first login screen" style={{width: '400px', maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto', borderRadius: '8px', boxShadow: '0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)'}} />

Simply fill in your email, full name, and password to create the initial admin account. This user will have full administrative privileges to configure providers, manage services, and access all OpsiMate features.

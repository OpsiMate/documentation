# Wellcome To OpsiMate

OpsiMate is an **open source alert management platform** that consolidates alerts from every monitoring tool, cloud provider, and service into **one unified dashboard**.

Stop switching between tools—see everything, respond faster, and eliminate alert fatigue.

## 🚨 Why OpsiMate

Modern teams rely on dozens of monitoring tools, each with its own dashboard, rules, and noisy alerts. That leads to:

- **Scattered visibility** across Grafana, Datadog, Kibana, cloud consoles, and more
- **Slow incident response** because context is spread across multiple systems
- **Alert fatigue** from duplicate, low-signal, or poorly routed alerts

OpsiMate brings everything together so you can:

- **Centralize alerts** from all your observability and infrastructure tools
- **Route and group alerts intelligently** by service, team, or severity
- **Act quickly** using a single, focused alerts workspace instead of 5–10 dashboards

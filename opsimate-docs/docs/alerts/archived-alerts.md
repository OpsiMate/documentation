# Archived Alerts

The **Archived Alerts** view is where you can see alerts that have **ended** or were **deleted/dismissed**.

Instead of losing context once an alert is no longer active, OpsiMate keeps a history so you can review what happened and learn from past incidents.

## What You See in Archived Mode

In the Archived Alerts view, you can:

- Browse alerts that are no longer active
- See when an alert started and when it ended
- Review severity, source integration, and affected services
- Inspect labels and other metadata for deeper analysis

This makes it easy to understand **what happened in the past**, not just what is happening right now.

## Analyzing Past Alerts

Use archived alerts to:

- Identify recurring problems and noisy services
- Spot patterns around specific integrations or environments
- Support post-incident reviews and long-term reliability improvements

You can filter and search archived alerts to quickly find the time ranges, services, or integrations you care about.

## 🔮 Coming Soon: Alert Reports

We are working on a feature to generate **alert reports** directly from your archived alerts:

- Export summary **PDF reports** of alerts for a given time range
- Share alert history with managers or stakeholders
- Use reports to support audits, reviews, and planning

This will make it even easier to turn your alert history into clear, shareable insights.

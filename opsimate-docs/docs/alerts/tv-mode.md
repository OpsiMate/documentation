# TV Mode View

The **TV Mode** view is the simplest way to see the alert status of your organization at a glance.

It is designed for **wall-mounted screens**, NOC rooms, and managers who want to understand
"what is the status of our systems right now?" in a single look.

## Why TV Mode

- Show the current alert situation on a dedicated screen
- Give managers and teams a clear, shared view of system health
- Reduce the need to click around dashboards during incidents

## Views in TV Mode

There are **two main views** available in TV Mode:

### 1. Simple Grid View

A clean grid that focuses on the most important information:

- List of active alerts in a compact table-like layout
- Key fields only (service, status, severity, source, time since started)
- Optimized for readability from a distance on large screens

Use this view when you want a straightforward overview that anyone can understand quickly.

### 2. Map View (Beta)

A **beta** visualization that shows alerts on a map-like layout:

- Visual clusters of alerts to highlight problem areas
- Ability to **group alerts** by different dimensions (for example service, environment, or region)
- Quickly see where issues are concentrated and how they relate to each other

Use this view when you want to explore patterns and relationships between alerts,
while still keeping a screen-friendly presentation.

TV Mode is ideal for always-on displays and shared spaces, so everyone can see at a glance
**how your organization is doing right now**.
